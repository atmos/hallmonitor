Hey, I’m u/catalisticise! After a while engaging here, I’ve noticed that this subreddit has insanely detailed conversations about the durability, sizing, DWR safety, merino micron count, pricing, temperature cases, and more regarding outlier’s clothing. Despite this (occasionally comical) discourse, there’s a conspicuous lack of pictures of the actual clothing being worn. Having been a fan of the brand for a few years, I’ve built up a wardrobe of a few pieces and wanted to share some of my favorite fits with all of the outlier items I own/have owned recently.

I’ll be sharing photos and brief reflections on these garments in the approximate order in which I obtained my first piece from each model. [If you wanna skip my ramblings and see the full fitpic album, here you go.](https://imgur.com/a/Tscd50A) For sizing, I’m 6’2 and weigh ~165-170 lb. I normally take size 31 in bottoms and large in tops and will include sizing and alterations done on any of these garments in the imgur albums for your reference. Without further ado, let’s get into it


[**60/30 chinos**](https://imgur.com/a/Zdy4VPI)

These were the bait that drew me in. I don’t think there’s anything I can say about these that hasn’t been said before, but I love hearing myself talk so I’ll go for it anyways. These pants just feel right, mostly because of the fabric. The cut has slightly too low of a rise and can be pretty tight in the quad area but the four way stretch and handfeel is perfect in every way. I wear these pants 3-5x a week (at least) and have worn them in just about every circumstance imaginable. My personal “uniform” is a solid color t shirt tucked into 60/30s with sneakers in the summer or boots (mainly docs) in the winter. It works for my work, for going out, for most dates, for hiking, for everything—it just works.

If 60/30s were what baited me in, these got me hooked. Grabbed this pair in my first WTF and rocked them a lot for a year or so before deciding to move to less tapered cuts. F cloth is an incredible fabric and I was always amazed at how much range of motion I had despite how close the cut really was to my body. What amazed me was these pants completely blew my second pair of pants, a pair of lululemon commission classics, out of the water so hard that I never wore the lulus again. The futuredarts had better drape, a better cut for me, mech pockets, and DWR. Again, these are what got me truly hooked on Outlier. Despite this, I recently sold my pair; I’m sad to see these go but am moving in a different direction with my wardrobe.

These are a crowd favorite but I’m honestly pretty mid on them. The fabric feels good in the summer but is very fragile in my experience. My favorite part about them is definitely the visual texture, which I think adds a lot to my outfits which can otherwise be pretty sterile most days. I’ll note that I sized up to 32 on both of these for wider legs because I didn’t want them to taper closely to my legs and like this fit a lot better than a “TTS” fit despite having about 3 inches of excess fabric at the waist.

Another classic that needs no introduction. These bois feel like they can take a beating and snap right back to form. I’ve worn them up to 90+ degrees with 90%+ humidity completely fine, however I think I’m more heat-tolerant than many people because of my physique and the fact that I was born and raised in a hot climate. Really incredible garment and fabric and I’m grateful that the big O is still making them. I will say my one gripe is that the allspice pair I own looks very synthetic, even from a distance, and that it’s noticeable enough for people to have commented on it.


[**Futureworks**](https://imgur.com/a/xZ4yiUg)

Got this pair in a WTF and rocked temporarily before gifting to a friend. The waist was too large for me and I didn’t want to risk tailoring it in with the gusseted construction in the thighs. Regardless, these are now my go-to recommendation whenever I talk to anyone about the brand: perfect balance of price-point, thoughtful construction, great fabric, and versatile cut.


[**F. cloth yes pants**](https://imgur.com/a/sIUIREG)

Decided to cop these in forest because of the lack of color in my bottoms and I couldn't be happier about it. F cloth takes color beautifully and looks “deeper” than many other synthetics that I’ve owned which I appreciate a lot. Was apprehensive on the cut at first until I realized that excess fabric doesn’t mean sloppy, it just means that things drape and interact in a way that I wasn’t used to before getting them. I rock them a lot now—even at work—but try to keep the elastic waistband hidden when other people are around because I think it looks too pajama-like for most fits. (Sidenote: I understand how the nomenclature works but I really dislike how cumbersome the name of these is. Why not just “futureyes” or “futurelounge” or something pls Abe)


[**Duckworks**](https://imgur.com/a/y5k2X7c)

Haven’t worn these enough to give really serious impressions as I got them at the end of summer and have only been able to wear them ~10 times since then. In short, the duckcloth is restrictive but armor-like and the cut looks drapes in these perfect circles for me. I honestly feel invincible when I’ve been clomping around in these plus boots but I won’t test that superpower any time soon (maybe after a few washes, who knows).

Like the duckworks, I haven’t rocked this as much as I would like due to higher than average temperatures this year. Interestingly, a lot of things that people dislike about this piece are my favorite parts of it: I love the wide neck and how hilariously oversized it is. Crooked seams are annoying when the shirt is laying down but unnoticeable when I’m wearing it, maybe because of how huge it is. The interior fabric took a second to get used to (felt itchy during my first wear) but is comfortable now, almost unnoticeable. Will likely get it cropped in the future to make it a 1:1 “boxy” fit.


[**Nylistic Merino Yes Pants**](https://imgur.com/a/dKBoIXt)

These are a new favorite. I’ve long been a fan of thick cotton (despite boyzboyz and abe both talking about how thicker cotton doesn’t necessarily equal quality) and this is like a ramped up version of that. The canvassy feel, the dry/neutral feel while wearing them, the perfect drape. Everything about these is great except for how massive they run. It may sound weird, but if I were ever to pick a lounge pant for the end of the world, this might be it. They feel sturdy enough to last forever but are somehow also comfy enough to just chill in. Amazing pants and fabric. I will note that the pair is labelled “dark navy” but is black imo, even in direct sunlight


[**No Pocket AMB**](https://imgur.com/a/WXY0iUo)

Unlike the rest of the world, I’ve been gravitating towards dressier clothes these past few months. Something about how a clean, slim dress shirt with 60/30’s and boots has really been hitting correctly for me despite the fact that I have no purpose in wearing these things. The AMB has been great for these fits, the fabric is just


[**Futurehighdarts**](https://imgur.com/a/cAEOHUC)

F cloth is nothing new to me, however this cut is. I’ve discussed it a lot on the discord but I have hilariously high hips and this lends to low- and mid-rise pants always feeling off for me. For the FHD’s, however, I feel like I’m wearing pants at the right height for the first time in my life. I’ll definitely be buying more high rise pants from Outlier, glad they’ve been experimenting in a way that feels novel yet comfortably familiar at the same time.
