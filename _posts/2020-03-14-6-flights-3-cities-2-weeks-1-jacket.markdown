**TL;DR:** The FCTJ has become indispensable in my work, travel, and casual wardrobes in cool weather. I would buy another in a heartbeat if they changed the Runweight lining.

#Background & Use Cases

I've always been a sweater/hoodie guy, and I have a few heavy jackets and shells, but I didn't really have a good mid-layer jacket in my wardrobe. I also travel frequently for work and sit through a lot of Ubers, airports, and airplanes.

With temperatures dropping to the 40s and highs still in the 70s in some places, I wanted something to keep me warm both inside airplanes and outdoors during chilly mornings and evenings, no matter what city I was in. I also wanted something breathable/cool enough for me to not overheat in when lugging around my carry-on and backpack.

Enter the [Futurecharge 120 Track Jacket](https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/futurecharge-120-track-jacket.html) (FCTJ). I wore this around for a bit at home [(initial impressions in this comment here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/comments/dm31fs/gostwyck_alphacore_zipfront_page_is_up/f4yovk9/) then wore it daily over two weeks as I traveled between Los Angeles, Atlanta, and San Francisco.

#Fit & Appearance

**Fit:**

At 5'10" / 160lbs / 36" chest, the size S jacket fits me perfectly.  I don't really feel like my movement is restricted at all, and the arms don't feel tight, even with a long-sleeved dress shirt (although my arms are pretty skinny); it does start to feel tight and constricting when holding my arms bent at an acute angle for a while, but I basically only experience this when holding up my phone in Ubers and planes. I can fit a big Champion reverse weave hoodie underneath, but it's a pretty snug fit and I probably won't ever wear it over a chunky sweater.

**Color:**

 I wish the Bluegrey color was a little more blue and a little less grey (I would've preferred the Marine from in the experiment run), but overall I like it, especially in natural light when the blue really comes out. Under warm indoor lighting, it can look [almost a little green/olive](https://i.imgur.com/ITPkFjy.jpg) at times and doesn't look as nice. The blue Runweight lining really pops in the light and I love the contrast to the more muted exterior.

**Appearance:**

Overall the FCTJ looks relatively basic and "safe", which makes it versatile. I can throw it on over a [t-shirt and Strongdarts at the zoo](https://i.imgur.com/tegZxgy.jpg), or over an [AMB Button Up and RM Williams at work](https://i.imgur.com/mz4cnrQ.jpg). It's not shiny and there's no quilting like other insulated jackets, and the details like the side zips, chest and back pockets, and the texture of the F.Cloth really set it apart from the Patagonias and North Faces I see people wearing at work and around town.

#Materials & Features

**Materials:**

Speaking of F.Cloth, I know it's been said a lot but I wasn't expecting how much I would love it as face fabric. It's tough, slightly stretchy, and has a really nice texture/handfeel. The odd drape on Futureworks/Futuredarts looks perfectly fine on the upper body. Stains come out easily with some spot cleaning. It has slight water and wind resistance. What's not to love? One caveat is that while it's relatively wrinkle resistant, once wrinkles are set they stay for a while, which you can see in the Michelin Man effect in the arms. You should also be careful with rough textures like velcro; I have two pairs of NWS with a lot of pilling in the butt area from a bag with a velcro strap that unknowingly rubbed against them for weeks before I noticed.

Runweight. It's there. It's the worst part of the jacket. 4 days and 1 flight in they [already started pilling in the lower back area](https://i.imgur.com/nvqr4I4.jpg). It catches on long sleeves when you put it on, and it even clings to boxier t-shirt sleeves like the [Uniqlo U tee](https://i.imgur.com/hHtMDTm.jpg). I have to kind of stuff the sleeves into the jacket armholes every time I put the jacket on over that T-shirt. The Runweight also pokes out of the sleeves when I first put the jacket on, although it stays in after I stuff it back. I tried turning the jacket inside out once and I think I would really like it if the lining was F.Cloth as well.

I said in my initial impressions that the Runweight doesn't feel as soft as I expected, but it's still plenty soft and cozy, especially when combined with the Polartec Alpha insulation. I haven't experienced any migration yet, but it could happen as seen in /u/OMURlCE's [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/comments/dfksk5/review_exp_130_futurecharge_track_jacket_1_year/). Abe & Tyler said in the IG live that you could probably machine wash the jacket if you zip all the zippers up, which is a huge plus. The three materials combined make the jacket feel very plush and it's almost like wearing a blanket, which brings me to…

**Warmth and performance:**

The FCTJ is warm, but it's not stuffy. I prefer to be on the warm side so I guess I run a little cooler. With the caveat that temperature ranges are subjective based on humidity and personal preference, this jacket works for me down to about 40 degrees with just a T-shirt if I'm moving around, and up to around mid-70s in a long-sleeve dress shirt with all the zips open in dry (SoCal) weather.

The jacket breathes *very* well; even when fully zipped up in a car with the heat blasting, I don't often feel sweaty in it, just hot. I wore it in a car without A/C and the windows up while [going down the Pacific Coast Highway in 75 degree, sunny weather](https://i.imgur.com/S2y7Yf1.jpg) and wasn't sweaty at all, although I was definitely warm. So it's definitely not ideal, but still passable, above 70 degrees.

At the zoo over the weekend, the weather was around 40 degrees in the morning and slightly windy. With just a cotton Uniqlo U t-shirt on, I was a little chilly in the shade when not moving around much but fine in the sun. It was perfect once the day warmed up to the low 50s, and I could wear it unzipped when I was moving around a lot.

**Features:**

The zips are all excellent, very smooth and satisfying to use. One feature that I didn't see in the FCTJ's competitors (especially the Veilance Mionn IS and the MW Northmar) is the two-way front zip. I hate how jackets bunch up when you sit down with them zipped up, and the two-way front zip solves that problem nicely since you can just unzip it a little from the bottom.

The side zips are perfect for *calibrating* and *dialing in* the warmth, although I haven't found much use for unzipping them from top to bottom. In most cases I find it easier to vent from bottom up, and it does change the silhouette a bit when [they're fully unzipped from top to bottom](https://i.imgur.com/0qNubRv.jpg). The only benefit to unzipping it that way for me is to keep the front of the jacket from flapping around, but I haven't had many situations yet where that would be useful. Given my experience with abrasion and F.Cloth, I wonder if the presence of the top zipper on the side zips is causing the migration in the armpits? Just a thought.

The pockets are all lined with Runweight, which is nice for the handwarmer pockets but gives me less confidence about stuffing abrasive things into the back pocket. I said in my initial review that I would be worried about the handwarmer pockets bagging out when putting heavy phones and such in them but that quickly went away after a few days; I juggle two phones and leave them in the pockets all the time and they're fine.

The handwarmer pockets are pretty far back, they're right on the side zip seam, which makes for a cleaner front face but also means they're pretty hard to get into when the jacket is unzipped. The jacket also [drapes/bulges in a weird way](https://i.imgur.com/WDwIsoJ.jpg) when resting my hands in them when it's unzipped, so I don't really use them when wearing the jacket open.

The chest pocket is *cavernous* - I knew it was big before I got the jacket but I didn't know that it goes from [seam to seam](https://i.imgur.com/5FouqFs.jpg), all the way up to the shoulder and even in the armpit area, where you can [fit an Airpods case](https://i.imgur.com/1TUMA7G.jpg), although you'll definitely feel it there. One downside to this is that phones or tall objects will often fall over in the pocket since it has that much room; it would be nice if there could be a pocket within the pocket to stop this from happening. I like how it doesn't really show objects that are in there; in most of my pictures I have my Slimfold wallet and Airpods case in the chest pocket and you can't really tell they're there unless you look closely. A nitpick I have is that the lip of the pocket isn't really structured at all so it can be hard to grab the small zipper at times.

The back pocket is nice for small flat objects like a battery pack or notebook, but I haven't really had the opportunity to keep those in there for long. I like that it's there though, I'll often stuff snacks and candy into it from the café at work. The only (small) issue I have with it is that the zipper goes from right to left, which is a bit inconvenient since I'm right handed and also inconsistent with the SftS, which unzips from left to right.

#Conclusion

This is a fantastic, versatile jacket that I intend to wear through the winter and spring, and I hope it'll be one of Outlier's core staples in the years to come. It keeps me warm on cold flights. I don't worry about overheating when juggling two phones, my backpack, and a carry-on. It can breathe more than a pug. It layers nicely underneath a shell. The only thing I wish would change would be the Runweight lining; something like AMB fabric would be nice but would also increase the cost. With how much I'm liking F.Cloth I would be really interested in seeing this in an F.Cloth sandwich, lining/face fabric combo.

This is my first review and I know it's a little long, thanks for reading! Any feedback you might have is welcome.
