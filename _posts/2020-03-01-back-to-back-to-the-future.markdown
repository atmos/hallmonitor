[My full review of the jacket here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/comments/duuo0y/6_flights_3_cities_2_weeks_1_jacket_futurecharge/) if you haven’t read it - written after 2 weeks of daily wear across 6 flights between Atlanta, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

[Full album](https://imgur.com/a/pig4u1B), which includes videos showing off the zips and features of the jacket. The boys on the Outlier discord saw it first: https://discord.gg/3zpgNUr3pc (you’ll find many of the regulars here - including myself - posting a lot more on the discord).

**TL;DR:** This is without a doubt my one of my most worn and most loved Outlier layers. Even after easily a hundred+ wears through hiking, biking, dozens of flights, and other activities it remains in great condition with many wears left in its future. If it doesn’t come back in some form I would be incredibly disappointed, but I hope elements of its design can find their way into Outlier’s future outerwear.

Last year on October 22, I received an email from Outlier. Coincidentally, it arrived exactly a week and one year to the day I was able to snag a Futurecharge 120 Track Jacket (FCTJ). The subject line immediately caught my eye:

#“Clothes Like Home”

To me, nothing embodies that line better than my FCTJ. From late October 2019 to today, I’ve worn it easily over a hundred times, across dozens of flights, and in at least four or five different regions across the country.

Putting it on for the first time in months last fall when temperatures finally reached the 50s and 60s after a hot and humid Georgia summer felt like coming home to a warm hug. And that’s what really stands out to me most with the jacket: the

#Comfort.

Most insulated mid layer jackets I’ve seen (I’ll get into those in a little more detail later) use a smooth synthetic lining, which makes putting them on and taking them off a breeze. But synthetics always feel cold to the touch at first, and in my experience it often feels like they conduct heat away from the body when it's cold.

The runweight lining in the FCTJ solves that “cold to the touch” issue with it being a knit blend of soft merino and polyester, but it being meant as a knit t-shirt material does mean it has its quirks when used as a liner. In my original review, I noted my gripes with the runweight lining: it’s loose and pokes out of the sleeves when you put on long sleeve shirts, it catches on long sleeve shirts and pulls up those long sleeves when you put the jacket on (you can see both effects in this [clip here](https://i.imgur.com/IWT0ms1.mp4)), etc..

I still stand by those complaints, but as time went on I started appreciating the runweight a lot more. The runweight pilling annoyed me at first, but when I’m wearing the jacket I really don’t feel it unless I consciously try to feel it, even though visually it [looks like it’s pilled a lot](https://i.imgur.com/a5oEQjD.jpg).

And my god does the runweight lining make the jacket comfy. The runweight interior combined with the tough* (with one big caveat that I talk about in the Issues section) F.cloth exterior creates this tough-on-the-outside / soft-on-the-inside contrast that just makes it such a joy to wear. I can wear the jacket while hiking or biking knowing that the face fabric can take a beating*, all while the runweight interior keeps me feeling cozy.

Of course all this tactile comfort would be a moot point if the jacket was too warm/not warm enough to comfortably wear in a variety of situations, which is where the zips come in (you can see all the zips in action [in this clip here](https://i.imgur.com/AFer4mQ.mp4)). All the zips coming together make the normally very warm jacket surprisingly comfortable in a wide temperature range, which is essential for my use cases.

In the pre-COVID times my job took me on flights twice a week, and hotels three nights a week nearly every week of the year. My schedule was highly unpredictable, and oftentimes the only consistent thing about my days was what I had in my suitcase and the clothes on my back. What stands out to me most when I think about why the FCTJ has had so much staying power with me is its

#Versatility.

As I noted in my original review, the pit zips and breathable materials make the FCTJ wearable in a wide range of temperatures. Of course I have to caveat this with the fact that perception of temperature is subjective and dependent on your activity level. Personally, I’ve found that I’m starting to run a little bit on the cooler side these past few years. While I used to be fine standing around in 60 F weather wearing just a tee, nowadays I’d prefer wearing something over it if I’m not moving much.

**Biking**

Just a few days after posting my first review, I spent a weekend in San Francisco with my gf on one of my ATL > LAX > SFO > ATL work rounds. The weather was very nice that weekend in SF: sunny with temperatures reaching the high 60s/low 70s, so we rented bikes from the Ferry Building to ride across the Golden Gate Bridge and back - a ~16.6 mile round trip.

Since I only had what I packed in my carry-on, I wore the FCTJ over a Uniqlo U tee and Strongdarts. It was [sunny in the city](https://i.imgur.com/isZx0xR.jpg), and with all the zips open the breeze kept me cool. [The fog was really rolling in over the bridge that day](https://i.imgur.com/h229XYq.mp4), so as we got closer to the bridge and it got colder and foggier, I gradually [zipped up more and more](https://i.imgur.com/Y7B3Wi4.jpg) to stay warm and dry.

**Hiking & temperature swings**

Early 2020 back in LA, my coworkers and I had planned a sunrise hike on the [Sandstone Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/sandstone-peak--4) to Sandstone Peak - the highest point in the Santa Monica mountains (I highly recommend this hike if you’re ever in the area, [the view was fantastic](https://i.imgur.com/lSraMaX.jpg)). This meant getting up at 4/5am and beginning the hike a little bit before dawn.

Temperatures were in the mid 40s and it was windy, especially as we got near the top. Wearing a pair of Strongdarts and my FCTJ over a Uniqlo U cotton tee, I was able to stay warm and regulate my temperature extremely well as I started moving and heating up, going from fully zipped up, to unzipping the front, to unzipping the pit zips as we made our way up the trail ([here’s a shot](https://i.imgur.com/V7a9ogE.jpg) partway up at dawn) and to the [summit](https://i.imgur.com/64tNCvL.jpg). With the sun out, temperatures were reaching the 60s by the time we made it back down. I changed out of the tee and Strongdarts and into a long sleeve dress shirt and chinos, but kept the FCTJ and wore it into my meetings.

It was in one of those meetings that day that I found out there was an abrupt change of plans. Instead of working in San Francisco the next week, I was needed in Boston where the highs were in the high 30s / low 40s. I had planned to stay the weekend in SF and was already going to fly there that day, but I would be needed in Boston next Tuesday and of course I didn’t have anything packed for the cold...

Temperatures had hit the 70s by the time I left the office in the afternoon to catch my flight to SFO - yet with all the zips open I was only a little warm wearing the FCTJ while lugging a backpack and carry-on through LAX. That weekend I bought a Uniqlo heattech shirt and flew to Boston armed with only that and my FCTJ. [It snowed a few days](https://i.imgur.com/5FIo4SN.jpg) that week (albeit barely), and I never spent more than an hour walking around outdoors/waiting in line for ramen, but the jacket (and heattech) kept me warm and happy whenever I was outside.

Biking, hiking, client meetings, 30-40 degree temperature swings, and running to catch flights with a backpack + carry-on sprinkled everywhere in between. In the fall/winter/spring, it wasn’t even a question which jacket I should wear; I wore the hell out of my FCTJ every day knowing that it could take whatever I threw at it. It checks almost all the boxes for me, especially when compared to the

#Competition.

Before getting the FCTJ and a couple of times afterwards, I’ve looked into other insulated jacket options. The big ones that I’ve seen recommended a lot are the Patagonia Nano Puff, Veilance Mionn IS, Arcteryx Atom AR/LT, and Mission Workshop Northmar.

There’s a lot I could say about why I personally prefer the FCTJ to those options, but this retrospective is starting to become a manifesto so I’ll try and keep it brief:

* **Lack of pit zips.** One of the reasons I’ve been able to wear the FCTJ across so many situations and temperatures that reach the 70s is the ability to open up the pit/side zips to let air flow through. None of those other options have pit zips, which would make them more uncomfortable in highly active situations or warmer temperatures.

* **Pockets pockets pockets.** Almost every single insulated jacket I’ve seen on the market has two hand warmer pockets and an internal chest pocket. Not only do you have to unzip the jacket to access internal chest pockets, but anything you put in internal chest pockets has a tendency to press against your chest when fully zipped up since those pockets bulge inward. The external chest pocket on the FCTJ adds visual interest to the front and has a ton of capacity (you can see it [in this clip here](https://i.imgur.com/a0EuSW1.mp4)), and since it’s external it’s harder to feel objects placed inside. The cherry on top is the back stash pocket. While I don’t often use it, I’ve always appreciated the fact that it’s there when my other pockets are full. I most often used it for snacks at work, and boy can it hold a lot: [in this clip](https://i.imgur.com/8X2ftJK.mp4) you can see I’ve stuffed a pack of Oreos in there, and [in this one](https://i.imgur.com/5cfAXdJ.mp4) you can see it easily holding a bag of Sour Patch Kids.

* **TWO👏WAY👏ZIPS👏** If I can’t have pit zips, the least that I want in an insulated jacket (or any jacket) is two-way zips. One of my biggest pet peeves in a jacket is the bunching that happens when it’s fully zipped up and you’re sitting down - you can see an exaggerated version of what I’m talking about [in this clip](https://i.imgur.com/NjYwiCF.mp4). As someone who wears insulated jackets while sitting down while working from home, or who used to sit in the window seat on freezing planes and wanted to nap on a redeye or early morning flight, two-way zips are essential. One common complaint I hear about them is that they can be finicky to engage, but the two-way zip Outlier used in the FCTJ absolutely nails it - buttery smooth and engages just as fast as a one-way zip (in fact even faster than some one-way zips I have). [Zipping/unzipping clip here](https://i.imgur.com/FBZ9igM.mp4)

The last thing I’ll mention is that I really appreciate the matte look of the F.cloth face fabric. Unlike many of the other options there’s no synthetic sheen to it at all, so it looks really nondescript and unique amongst the sea of insulated jackets in the office during fall and winter. However, F.cloth is not without its

#Issues.

*F.cloth is described as strong, durable, and lightweight. And it definitely is all those things...except when it comes to abrasion. This is something I’ve encountered in the past on my New Way Shorts - the [hip area in both my shorts fuzzed up and pilled](https://imgur.com/a/SaEiNFx) after a velcro strap from a hip bag rubbed against it for weeks on a study abroad trip. I started seeing similar pilling on my FCTJ in the middle back area (direct sunlight shot [here](https://i.imgur.com/4xBcYb1.jpg), indirect natural light shot [here](https://i.imgur.com/x8xfwIj.jpg)), which I think came from mesh back office chairs. There’s also a [tiny bit of fuzzing](https://i.imgur.com/FNagqN4.jpg) on the [collar as well](https://i.imgur.com/K3eCrCu.jpg), which probably comes from rubbing against my hair. I can only imagine what a backpack with mesh straps would do to the shoulders, but it probably wouldn’t be pretty.

I suspect this abrasion issue with F.cloth could be the culprit for the other problem: the insulation [has leaked](https://i.imgur.com/QV5aMmu.jpg) a bit through [the armpits](https://i.imgur.com/CUoHt1B.jpg). It’s not a lot and I haven’t noticed the jacket losing its warmth because of it, but both these issues make me more wary with the jacket around rough surfaces now. This seems like it might be an inherent problem with F.cloth itself - folks I’ve talked to who own the Alphacharge Track Jacket (which uses Ultra Ultra as the face fabric) haven’t experienced any leaking, although that uses Polartec 60 insulation vs. the Polartech 120 in the FCTJ so I’m not sure how that variable affects things.

These issues also highlight a concern about Outlier’s wildly experimental outerwear and smaller scale: the lack of a long-term warranty. Had any of those above issues happened to me with another brands’ insulated jacket like the Veilance Mionn or Patagonia Nano Puff, I could probably count on them to repair it or replace it with an entirely new one under warranty. Even if Outlier did offer replacements, I’m not sure if the FCTJ is ever coming back again so I don’t know how it could be replaced.

Lastly (and this is more of a personal preference thing and less an inherent issue with the materials) the jacket is definitely hefty, easily the heaviest out of all the other insulated jacket options I was considering. I don’t notice this heft at all while wearing it, but definitely do when I have to take it off and carry it. It also doesn’t pack down much at all, which could be an issue for people looking for an easily stowable jacket.

#To conclude:

Despite the issues noted above, this is a piece that I see myself wearing for years and years to come. Outside of watching out for abrasion, I’ve never really thought about babying it at all throughout my hundred plus wears, and it still looks almost like it did after the first few weeks of wear when I wrote my first review.

The whole concept of clothes that you can wear to climb a mountain and also wear to a Michelin star restaurant in the same day gets memed a lot here, but I feel like the FCTJ is the closest to that ideal in my wardrobe. I’ve literally worn it to summit Sandstone Peak in the morning, then to work in a business casual office during the day, then through an airport and a flight in the afternoon, and finally dinner at a restaurant in the evening, all in the same day. I’ve worn it underneath my Shelter from the Storm [while hiking](https://i.imgur.com/BfFZxjp.jpg), and also [on a flight](https://i.imgur.com/F1SIatD.jpg). I can wear it [casually around town](https://i.imgur.com/uNfweLH.jpg), or over business casual to the office and straight to the bar after work [to get drunk](https://i.imgur.com/dDPBiMU.jpg) with coworkers.

I know planning and design for FW21 pieces is probably already underway, but I hope this can at least get the Outlier folks to think about bringing the track jacket form back this year. The FCTJ to me is quintessential Outlier: taking a simple idea (an insulated jacket), remixing it with a unique combination of materials (F.cloth, Polartec Alpha, Runweight Merino), and adding the finishing features (two way zips, pit zips, pockets) to create something that is truly distinct and can’t be found anywhere else. It’s pieces like this and the Shelter from the Storm that keep me invested in the brand and motivates me to write a nearly 3000-word long manifesto about some jacket that I like to wear for internet randos to read.

If you just skimmed through all this I don’t blame you; if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading!
